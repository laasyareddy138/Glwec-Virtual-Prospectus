In a recent survey, some top notch women in Tech jobs listed some of the myths about women:They are not good at stem jobs,They cannot be entrepreneurs, barrier breakers, innovative thinkers. They are not made for hard core jobs, critical thinking, problem solving, working with equipment, etc. Here at G L W E C, we address all these problems one by one and try to create a place for our girls amidst of these challenges.
